We have made a `Maze Creator and Solver` using C.  
Usage:  
It will first ask for the dimensions of the maze that you desire to generate (int the format of nxm).  
Then, it will generate the maze of the required size and ask if you want to solve it (you need to press 1 in order for it to solve the maze).  
It will then output the correct co-ordinates for the required solution path.
